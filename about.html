	<p id = "pabout">I'm currently a Computer Science major at Carnegie Mellon University although I am originally from the city of Dallas, TX. I am relatively new to computer science and programming and this website is my first personal project! I am an avid learner who enjoys trying new things. My most recent obsessions consist of coding, rock-climbing, and experimenting in the kitchen. Check out my blog, <a id = "speciallink" href = "#">here</a>!</p>
